# Todo-app-using-React
A basic todo app created using reactit also cotains data from json placeholder for getting some of the todos

we have installed uuid npm i uuid
                  react-router npm react-router-dom npm i react-router-dom
                  axios npm i axios
                  
We have also used axios get,post and delete requests for adding,removing and displaying todos
The todos after completed have a checkbox
